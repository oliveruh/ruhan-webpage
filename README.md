## How This Started üå±

I built this site with three things in mind:

1. **Show Off My Skills**:I wanted a place to showcase what I can do
2. **Play & Learn**: Test out cool tech I've been itching to try
3. **Share Knowledge**: Document my process for other devs (and future me)

What began as a simple resume page during some late-night coding (fueled by way too much coffee) grew into something much bigger - a digital representation of my professional self.

## Tech Choices That Made Sense üõ†Ô∏è

**What I'm Working With:**  
- React + TypeScript: Because it's fast and developer friendly
- Vite: Because life's too short for slow build times  
- CSS Modules: Keeping my styles from fighting each other  
- React Icons: One system to rule them all  

**Smart Decisions I Made:**  
- Built for search engines first, without sacrificing the SPA experience
- Mobile-friendly from day one (not as an afterthought)
- Performance tracking with every deploy
- Components that don't care where their content comes from

## Why I'm Documenting Everything üìò  

**This site serves two masters:**  
- Clients see what I can deliver
- Fellow devs can peek under the hood

**Coming Soon:**  
- Video walkthroughs of how I built key features
- Real-world performance optimization stories
